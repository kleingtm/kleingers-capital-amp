The Need for Currency

Currency was quite literally

&nbsp;for the purpose of abstracting away inherent value.

<span class="c2">

</span>

        </p>

        <p class="c1">

<span class="c2">
Why? Because it’s extremely inefficient to carry around ounces of gold, barrels of oil, horses, or other items people may or may not value.

<span class="c2">

</span>

        </p>

        <p class="c1">

<span class="c2">
It’s not like the world hasn’t tried it. Many economic models throughout history consisted of bartering for inherently valued goods. And all of those economies were extremely inefficient.

<span class="c2">
Say, for example, you were a blacksmith and needed a horse. Unfortunately, the person selling a horse doesn’t need anything made of metal and happens to value gold. You then began tracking down the person holding gold. As it turns out, the person holding gold only values food for feeding a family. You see where this is going…

Cryptocurrencies Don’t Inflate

The only way to change or inflate the currency would be to change the algorithm in the source code. Changing source code to inflate the coin would require a hard fork, which means a new coin would be created. In such a scenario, the original currency would still exist - unaltered and without inflation.

The Byzantine Generals Problem describes a situation where a group of generals are approaching battle and must agree upon a battle plan. They can only communicate with one another through messengers, of which there’s no guarantee of successful delivery. Additionally, there’s the possibility of disloyal generals sending messages that attempt to compromise the mission, or promote their own self-interest.
